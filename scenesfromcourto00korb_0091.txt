PUNISHMENT OF THE STRELITZ 61

storm with profuse liberality and, with promise of
higher rewards‚ seduced her 1ο forbidden deedS.

WVhen the old hag, full of such grand hopes, prom-
ised to execute to the minutest detail all her lady’s
bidding, Sophia taught her what 1ο guard against
and what to do, and told her that she would pretend
to give her a loaf as her usual alms, that she would
bring it to the Strelitz and should wait to see whether
they would entrust her with any answer. There
were letters enclosed in the loaf, in which she assured
the rebels that she would make strong efforts in aid
of their laudable undertakings3 let them only come
to the monastery, slay all the guards that would
resist; that things had come to such a pass, that
there was no happy auspices for them without shed-
ding blood. The rebels in like manner transmitted
their answers to Sophia in a loaf. The thing was
done several times and the soldiers had no suspicion
of it-—so ingenious is malice in plotting mischief.
After all she deceived herself3 and that loaf which
they meant to make 1119 broad of death to so many
innocent people‚ led to their own richly deserved
ruin‚ and was most fatal to themselves.

THE FmsT EXECUTION.—- IOth October, 1698.—
To this exhibition of avenging justice the Czar’s
Majesty invited all the ambassadors of foreign sov-
ereigns‚ as it were to assert anew on his return that
sovereign prerogative of life and death which the
rebels had disputed with him.
