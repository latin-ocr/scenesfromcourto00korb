IN TRODUCTION xxiii

Latin ’³ of the German diplomat, thus endeavoring
to make this translation as faithful as possible to the
original. His translation is fairly complete except
for a few slight omissions made as a concession to
the mid-Victorian taste of his time.

In this edition no effort has been made to repro-
duce the diary in full as that would involve the in-
clusion of a large amount of redundant and unin-
teresting matter, important only to the meticulous
savant. The editor has rather aimed at a careful
selection of those portions of the work which are
important and significant and those which reveal the
personality of Peter the Man whose human interest
will outlive the political power of the Romanoff
dynasty. For it is the intention of tnls volume as
of the whole series to meet the needs less of those

who write history than of those who read it.
