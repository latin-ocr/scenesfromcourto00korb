est military powers of Europe. He had entered
the conflict with an army which firmly believed that
every Swedish soldier had a devil behind him to point
his musket and make him invulnerable‚ a superstition
which made the Russian soldiers run in numbers at
the first sight of a handful of Swedes. ’Such were
the men Peter led to victory and such was the enemy
he taught them to beat.

His labors‚ however, as well as his excesses had
already undermined his iron constitution and though
not yet fifty-three years of age, he was already an
old man. During the summer of 1724 the state of
Peter’s health caused grave anxiety and in autumn
he had another violent attack of his paroxysms.
Ignoring the advice of his physicians he undertook
an arduous tour of inspection and visited some of
his iron mines, even digging out with his own hands
a piece of iron ore weighing 120 pounds. In the
beginning of November, at Lakhta, seeing a boat
grounded on a shoal‚ loaded with soldiers in imminent
danger of being drowned‚ he plunged into the water
to go to 'their rescue and stayed immersed for a
considerable time. He returned to St. Petersburg
dangerously ill and after a protracted and painful
agony he died on the evening of February 8 (N. S.),
1725, in the arms of his second wife, the Empress
Catherine. Of his last message scribbled on a sheet
of paper two words only were legible: “Forgive
everything.'’
