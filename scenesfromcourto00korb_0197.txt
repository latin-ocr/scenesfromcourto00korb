APPENDIX 167

Menshikow wrote: “Since one of my daughters pos-
sesses a dwarf girl and the other does not, therefore I
beg you kindly to ask Her Majesty, the Czarina, to
allow me to take one of the dwarfs which were left after
the death of the Czarina Martha.'’ No noble residence
was considered well furnished without dwarfs and the
birth of a dwarf was even considered a piece of good
luck. There is a decree in the archives of the Senate
granting freedom from serfdom to the father and family
of a dwarf. XVhen Peter as a child went to chureii, a
double row of dwarfs, carrying red silken curtains, fol-
lowed him, a moving prison, always with him.

GERMAN SLowonA (also “ Dutch Suburb'' or “ Ger-
man Settlement ”).-— Beyond the gates of the old cap-
ital, towards the north-western corner of the modern
city of Moscow, there arose, on the borders of the
Jaouza, (Iausa) a scanty affluent of the Moscva river,—
a kind of Ghetto, specially assigned to the Niemtsy, i. e.
those who did not speak the tongue of the country, and
who in consequence, were niemoi, dumb. In the middle
ages there were a few German merchants here from the
Hansa cities. In the 17th century there were besides
the Dutch and Germans many Englishmen and Scotch-
men, exiles during Cromwell’s rule. Later the French-
men came, when Louis XIV. drove the protestants out
of Franee. New political and Scientific ideas from
WVestern Europe were here and the more enlightened
of the Russian statesmen like Basil Galizin went thcrc
to dine and talk with the foreigners. Czar Peter too
frequented the Dutch Suburb with his “ jolly company,”
i. e. his friends, favoritcs and casual acquaintance-5.
