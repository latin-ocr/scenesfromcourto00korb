PUNISHMENT OF THE STRELITZ 69

donowski‚ solicited his salary; and the Prince an-
swering that he was ready to lend money at interest,
he replied, without hesitating‚ that except his wife
he had no other pledge to offer3 but if the Princo
was resolved to lend money, that he was ready either
to pawn 01· sell her. In other respects his Maje·sty
all through, with a perfectly open countenance, gave
evidence of his internal gayety.

SEVENTH ExsscmmN.— Wth October, 1698.—
To-day was assigned for the punishment of the popes
-that is to say, of those who by carrying images
to induce the serfs to side with the Strelitz, had
invoked the aid of God with the holy rites of his
altars for the happy success of this impious plot.
The place selected by the judge for the execution
was the open space in front of the church of the most
Holy Trinity, which is the high church of Moscow.
The ignominous gibbet cross awaited the popeS‚ by
way of reward in suit with the thousands of signs of
the cross ‘they had made, and as their see for all the
benedictions they had given to the refractory troops.
The court jester, in the mimic attire of a pope, made
the halter ready, and adjusted it, as it was held to
be wrong to subject a pope to the hands of the
common hangman. A certain Dumnoi struck off
the head of another pope, and set his corpse upon
the ignominious wheel. Close to· the church‚ too, the
haltcr and wheel proclaimed the enormity of the
crime of their guilty burden to the passers by.
