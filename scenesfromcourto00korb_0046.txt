16 COURT OF PETER THE GREAT

and repress with strong succors the disturbers of
the public peace, and force them the more effica-
ciously into the reverence due to their lawfully elected
king.

But how wonderful are 'che vicissitudes of fortune
and of human affairs! The fiood burst in wild rage
upon him, who rashly thought to brave the unruly
inundation that menaced the quiet of a neighboring
nation. Four regiments of the Strelitz, which lay
upon the frontier of Lithuania had nefariously
plotted to change the sovereignty. The regiment of
Theodosia abandoned Viasma, the Athanasian regi-
ment quitted Piala, the Isano-Tzernovio-VVlodomir-
ian left Ostheba‚ and the Ticchonian quitted Dorogo-
busa, in which places they were in garrison. They
drove away the loyal officers that happened to be
among them, distributed military rank among them-
selves,— the readiest for crime being held the fittest
for command. At once they menaced death to all in
their next neighborhood if they would not freely join
their party, or should resist their design.

Many reports spread through Moscow about the
danger that was so near at hand, but what real truth
was in them nobody knew: until at length the meeting
of the BoyarS, their consultations repeated day after
day, their assembling by night, and their assiduous
conferenees might have proved to anybody how
grave a business it was, and what imminent need
there was to press on their conclusions to maturity.
