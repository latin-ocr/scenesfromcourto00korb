REVOLT OF THE STRELITZ 27

have been recalled from exile, to aid Sophia with
prudent advice.

Now, as any one of the points of this confession
was of itself weighty enough to merit death, General
Schachin had the sentence that was drawn up against
them, promulgated and executed. Numbers were
condemned to be hanged and gibbeted3 many laid
their heads upon the fatal block and died by the
ax, many were reserved to certain vengeance, and
laid in custody in places in the environs. It was
contrary to Genera] Gordon’s and Prince Masatski’s
advice that the Gencral proceeded to execute the
rebels; as in this manner the chiefs of the revolt may
without sufficient examination, have been removed,
by premature death, from further inquest. Hence
he drew upon himself, not undeservedly, the fury of
a more wary avenger, when, amidst the gayeties of
a royal banquet he would have died the death, had
not the stout arm of General Lefort drawn back and
refrained the hand that was descending to the stroke.
But, at the time in question, Schachin was of a dif-
ferent opinion, believing that timely severity would
have the salutary consequence of restoring to the
minds of numbers reverence for the monarch and
fcar of punishment. And for this reason—to
strikc terror into the rest by an example of public
vcngeance—-he on one day broke seventy, and an-
other ninety, upon the cross they so richly deserved.
