42 COURT oF PETER THE GREAT

After this an agate vessel, full of most precious
brandy, was produced, and a tiny cup made out of a
ruby, which the Pristaw filled. They then sat down
to table: the Lord Envoy had the place of honor,
the Pristaw had the second. Mr. Carbonari and
Mr. Pleyer, and the four missionaries, had been in-
vited3 and besides these, all the Lord Envoy's offi-
cials. To these brandy was handed round after they
had sat down. Then the viands were brought in.
Among the roasts was a swan3 there were no less
than a hundred and eight dishes counted, but ex-
cessively ,few that a German palate could relish.
The Pristaw’s first toast was to the health of his
sacred Majesty the Emperor; the second, the health
of his Majesty the Czar3 the third, the health of
the faithful ministers of the most august Emperor
and the most serene Czar. The wily Pristaw had
tried to derange this order, and had asked the Lord
Envoy to fill a cup and propose a toast to the health
of somebody: but he took nothing by his misplaced
subtlety3 for the Lord Envoy replied that he was
not thirsty, and that it was not his part as guest to
propose a toast3 let him, as he was playing the part
of host in the Czar’s name, fulfill his office as he
thought right. There was a crowd of Muscovites
standing by, who had flocked into the room to serve
and pay their court, to all of whom, as they came up
in turn, each according to his condition, the Lord
Envoy handed a cup of wine with his own hand,
