108 COURT OF PETER THE GREAT

death was done he fled to the Lord Envoy of Poland
for sanctuary3 but it was an unhappy thought, for
the Envoy, being on the point of leaving Muscovy
from day to day, was in doubt whether he could eon-
vey the poor wretch safely away, and so he himself
hastily, and too thoughtlessly, conducted the man
in a sledge from the Ambassadorial Court into the
German suburb,-— from a place of asylum and safe
concealment into open peril of prison, life, and ex-
ecution3 fancying that he would be longer safely
hidden in Colonel de Gordon’s house, who was in the
Czar's service, and had a right to give orders to
anybody, than among those whom the unanimous
consent of nations far and wide has surrounded with
a barrier, as it were, sacred, legal and inviolate.
The Envoy’s going in person in the evening, and in
such turbulent haste, towards the German Slowoda‚
gave rise to a suspicion of whom he was bringing.
No sooner was he brought back than, trace of him
being found, the juggler was delivered up, upon
summons of the head man3 the sentence of the pop-
ulace, as usual, having decreed peculiarly atrocious
pains for him for having deprived a wife of her hus-
band and left four children fatherless. Under the
penal question, the pangs of which he thrice bore
to the envy of the Muscovites, he alleged the neees-
sity he was under of killing in his own defense, that
he was driven to that crime in order to escape being
strangled by the other, as was imminent.
