STUBBORNNESS OF MUSCOVITES 51

He said that in all these things he had surpassed
himself and his associatos3 and that those who, after
being aspirants for membership, were found unable
,to go through the first tortum, were made away with
by poison, or in some other way, for sear they should
betray. Thai: as far as he could remember, at least
four hundred such inapt candidates had been killed
by himself and his comrades. Thus this fellow bore
ten times the most unheard of tortures; six times
from his associates‚ and four times in the inquil-y
before the Czar. He is still living, and, as I have
set down above, is now by the Czar’s clemency a
colonel and away in Siberia.

A case of similar stubbornness occurred when the
Czar was returning to Moscow from Vienna. He
had already passed Smolensk and was approaching
his capital, when one of his suite, terrified at having
committed some flagrant act, sought safety in flight.
The inquirers could find no indication of the direc-
tion or road he had taken3 when at length a peasant
from the next hamle'c came and said that indeed he
knew no particulars about the fugitive, but that he
had seen a horse in a neighbor’s house. The Czar
detained the informer, and sent off Mr. Adam Weyd
to the house designated, to obtain more positive in-
formation. He saw the horse, and on his return con-
firmed the peasant's story to the Czar.
