164 COURT OF PETER THE GREAT

Envoy got into his own carriage, and so drove off
with the rest to that estate. Receiving his guests
there with much politeness‚ the proprietor pointed
out his conveniences for the chase on an adjacent hill
that was studded with little thickets‚ and sloped with
a gentle declivity into a valley3 and he sought to
win back the offended spirit of the Lord Envoy by
the offer of two sporting dogs‚ which he warranted
capital. After tarrying for a brief space here,
thanks were given and farewell bidden not only to
the Boyar, but to all the guests present. Colone]
Gordon’s main task was to excuse his father of the
offense received in his person from the Boyar. Col-
one] de Grage and the Czar’s doctor, Carbonari‚ fol-
lowed our tents three versts further.

Beneath the open sky, under canvas, we passed the
night. But as a scarcity of water was apparent,
the Lord Envoy not unjustly inveighed against the
Czar’s pristaw, for it was incumbent on him to have
provided against such circumstances. Although
there was no inn near, still we were not afflicted with
any scarcity of eatables or drinkables.

&Aah Julgs, 1699.—— After solemn leave-taking on
both sides, those returned to Moscow, who as I have
already said, accompanied us to the field and to our

tents; and we too speedily started on an opposite
route.
