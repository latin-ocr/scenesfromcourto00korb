Kremlin‚ have been commanded to ¹des'croy them with-
out any subterfuge, as quickly as possible, under
penalty of confiscation of goodS‚ and corporeal pains
at discretion. They will have it, that the motive
of this edict is the beautifying and ornamenting of
the city.

The Czar’s banquet, at which it is the old custom
and usage to receive representatives on their de-
parture, was given to the Lord Envoy of Poland‚

5th November, 1698).- In virtue of yesterday’s
ukase, the shops near the Castle of the Kremlin are
already destroyed, -so urgent is obedience.

By another ukase of the Czar‚ all tolerably grown
and robust boys are to be sent to Veroneje, to learn
shipbuilding from the workmen there. The first
200, who are to be sent from thence into Holland,
began their journey to-day‚ Two sons of the late
General Menzies were let off, on the grounds of their
weakly age.

Sth November, 1698— Doctor Zoppot‚ having
complained to Genera] Lefort of his interpreter be-
ing carricd off by force, Romadonowski sent him back
to-day upon compulsion. A clerk from the Czar’s
chancery brought a monkey to the same physician
with an order for him to exert his skill to cure him.
Zoppot excused himself on the ground of his igno-
rance of the Russian idiom‚ and suggested his col-
league Carbonari as more capable of the cure, on
account of his skill in that tongue.
