had not sufficient eourage for that office, he was
deemed worthy of being told that he was an ass.
When the execution was over, it pleased the Czar's
Majesty to sup at Genera] Gordon’s3 but he showed
no sign of cheerfulness‚ insisting to several upon the
obstinaey and stubborness of the criminals. He de-
tailed with indignant words to General Gordon and
the Museovite magnates present, that one of the con-
demned was so insolent that he deu-ed, just as he was
about lying down upon the bearn, to address the Czar
with these words: “Make way, my lord, it is for
me to lie here.” Out of 150, only three confessed
themselves guilty of the· crime and treason, and
begged pardon of the Czar’s Majesty there present,
for which they were held worthy of their Sovereign’s
clemency, were freed from the penalty of death, and
obtained pardon for their delict. But for next day
a fresh scene of execution was being dccked; and the
Czar invited Genera] Gordon to it, telling him that
he wished to execute the criminals by a new mode,
unknown to his people, to wit, with the sword in-
stead of the ax. Moreover, the often—mentioned
Alexander ⁶ showed that evening‚ riding in an open
carriage through all the thoroughfares of the city,
by the exceedingly frequent flourishing of a naked
sword how sanguinary a tragedy he expected next
day.
