FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF MOSCOW 9

the Lord Envoy, who at all times was most cautious
to prevent any quarrel, especially with people not
belonging to the house, hastily arranging his dress,
mounted the first horse at hand to see for himself
what was the matter; but the affair had already been
settled without wounds on either side.

lst June, 1698.—- At about an hour's distance
from the city of Moscow, there is a green grove on
the bank of the river Jausa, whither daily flock‚ in
spring and summer, the Germans established in Mos-
cow. The place is so familiar to every German of
them all, from constantly going there, that it seems
almost to belong to himself. Their sole amusement
is to gladden their souls among these shady thiekets
and pleasant green trees with their usual innocent
games. Here too they spread the board‚ alternating
the expenses with one another. It was Colonel de
Grage’s turn to-day3 he politely invited us to enjoy
this gentle recrea'cion, and we willingly accepted.

&th June, 1698.--A counci] of war was held by
the Boyars at a place a mile distant from Moscow.
A most commodious traveling carriage, with six
homes, beautifully ornamented and with richly-
wrought trappings and housings was sent to the
Prime Minister,3 at his own request, by the Lord
Envoy who was not unaware that they would never
return to his stables.
