156 COURT OF PETER THE GREAT

Most Serene to longest forgetfulness. They re-

mained a quarter of an hour, and praised exceedingly
the skill of all the musicians.

leth July, 1699.——A Lithuanian Catholic boy,
seduced by the Muscovites‚ fied from our kitchen to
a certain Russian prince‚ to embrace the Russian re-
ligion, in the hope of getting a wife, as they had
promised him upon that condition. Knes Repnin,⁷
Colonel of the Dragoons‚ and his servants, stung by
some gad-fly to fremy, broke violently in upon the
city guard, and as he was on the point of snatching
away the colors, the ensign received him upon his
pike in the most creditable manner. Several others
were wounded in the strife on both sides.

ΙᾼΗι Julgy, 1699.— Came Dia‘k Jacob Nikonow‚
having heard of the complaints of some of our peo-
ple, who· had been uncivilly affronted lately by the
swatch‚ and after previously examining the accused
dragoons, condemned them all eight, notwithstanding
the splendor of their birth —— for they were noble —
to the penalty of the battok. By order of the Czar
the sentence was executed in the Court of the Am-
bassadorial Palaee, the number of 'blows with which
they were to be chastised was left to the arbitrament
of those to whom their evil stars had‘led them to give
very ill-treatment.

⁷ Prince Anikita Repffin, who was a constant friend of Peter

the Great. He rose to be a field marshal. The family is
extinct in the male line.
