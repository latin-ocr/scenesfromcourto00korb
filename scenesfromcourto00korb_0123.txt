LIFE AT THE *CZAR’S COURT 93

strewn on the threshold as a token of fertility and
plenty and while the guests are regaling themselves
the newly wedded couple proceed to the consumma-
tion of the marriage. After they have reposed for
some two or three hours upon the nuptia] couch,
some of the banqueters are assigned to go to them
and inquire of the bridegroom whether he has found
the bride a virgin. If he answers in the affirmative
to the great joy of the guests‚ the bridal couple are
led amid dancing to the bath which has been adorned
with sweet smelling herbs. Having bathed to their
pleasure, they are led back to the banquet hall where
they receive an abundance of congratulation. If
on the other hand the bridegroom complains that the
bride has already been seduced‚ she is repudiated and
sent back to her parents. Not even the chastity of
our age could improve upon this test for determining
virginity.
