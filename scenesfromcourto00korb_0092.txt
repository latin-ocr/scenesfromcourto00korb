62 COURT OF PETER THE GREAT

The barracks in Bebraschentsko end in a bare
field which rises to the summit of a rather steep
hill. This was the place appointed for the execu-
tions. Here were planted the gibbet stakes‚ on
which the foul heads of these confessedly guilty
wretches were to be set, to protract their ignominy
beyond death. There the first scene of the tragedy
lay exposed. The strangers that had gathered to
the spectacle were kept aloof from too close ap-
proach3 the whole regiment of guards was drawn in
array under arms. A little further off, on a high
tumulus in the area of the place, there was a multi-
tude of Muscovites‚ crowded and erushing together
in a dense circle. A German Major was then my
companion; he concealed his nationality in a Mus-
covite dress, besides which he relied upon his military
rank and the liberty he might take in consequence
of being entitled by reason of his being in the service
of the Czar to share in the privileges of the Mus-
covites. He mingled with the thronging crowd of
Muscovites, and when he came back announced that
five rebel heads had been cut off in that spot by an
ax that was swung by the noblest arm of all Mus-
covy.5 The river Jausa fiows past the barracks in
Bebraschentsko, and divides them in two.

On the opposite side of this stream there were a
hundred criminals set upon those little Muscovite
carts which the natives call Sbosek, awaiting the

5 Ι. e. the Czar himself.
