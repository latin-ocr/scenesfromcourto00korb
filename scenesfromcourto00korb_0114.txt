84 COURT OF PETER THE GREAT

forbade the admission of any person to the table of
former Czars. They used to dine alone; but they
were accustomed to send some dishes from their table
to any of the Boyars that they wished to honor with
an especial mark of favor. The present Czar, on
the other hand, considers it a decided affront to
kings that they should be repelled from the pleasures
of private society, arguing why should a barbarous
and inhuman law be enacted against kings alone, to
prevent them enjoying the society of anybody? So
that, neglecting the proud solitude of his own table,
he is fond of conversing and dining with his advisers‚
with the German officers, with merchants, and even
with the ambassadors of foreign princes, Though
this be sovereignly displeasing to the MuscoviteS,
yet, as they must needs obey‚ they had to adopt the
same fashions, and often exhibit a smiling counte-
nance upon compulsion.

THE CzAR’s ResmENcR— It is called the
Kremlin —is surrounded with a stone wall two miles
and nine hundred paces in eircumference, and com-
prises several very handsome structures belonging
to the noblesse within the ambit of its enclosure, sev-
eral bazaars, several churches —— as, for example, the
Church of the Archangel Michael, which contains the
royal tombs. Blagavesine, or the Church of the An-
nunciation, is remarkable for its nine towerS, the
roofs of which, as well as the whole chureh, are cov-
ered with gilt copper, and the highest tower thereos
