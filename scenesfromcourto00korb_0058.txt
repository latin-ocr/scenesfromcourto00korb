28 COURT OF PETER THE GREAT

How sharp was the pain, how great the indigna-
tion to which the Czar’s Majesty was mightily
moved, when he knew of the rebellion of the Strelitz,
betrayed openly a mind panting for vengcance. He
was still tarrying at Vienna, quite full of the desire
of Setting out for Italy3 but, fervid as was this
curiosity of rambling abroad, it was nevertheless,
speedily extingui-shed on the announcement of the
troubles that had broken out in the bowels of his
realm. ‘Going immediately to Lefort (the only per-
son almost that he condescended to treat with in-
timate familiarity), he thus indignantly broke out:
‘⁶ Tell me, Francis, son of JameS, how Ι can reach
Moscow, by the shortest way, in a brief space, so
that I may wreak vengeance on this great perfidy of
my people, with punishments worthy of their fla-
gitious crime. Not one of them shall escape with
impunity. Around my royal city, of which, with
their impious efforts, they meditated the destruction,
I will have gibbets and gallows set upon the walls
and ramparts, and each and every of them will I put
to a direful death.'’

Nor did he long delay the plan for his justly ex-
cited wrath3 he took the quick post, as his ambas-
sador suggested, and in four weeks’ time, he had got
over about three hundred miles3 without accident,
and arrived on the aith of September, a monarch for
the well—disposed, but an avenger for the wicked.
