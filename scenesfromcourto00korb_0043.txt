F‘IRST IMPRESSIONS OF MOSCOW 13

young Circassian Prince, who a considerable time
ago was torn away by violence from his parents,
princes of the Tartar Circassians, and christened.
A very rich widow of the Galizin family adopted him
as her heir, in order ’to console him for the patri-
mony which he had lost by being stolen and ’torn
away from his father. He keeps a Pole as tutor 'co
these youths: 'they are at present engaged learning
Latin. The disposition of ’che Galizins appeared
meek. On ’che contrary ’che Circassian’s noble and
daring countenance seemed an index of 'che warlike
soul with which he was born.

Prince Galizin at length put us all in amaze by
the atrocious invectives and threats into which he
broke out at 'che pedagogue. ‘⁶ Thou ’craitor to mc
and mine, how durs’c 'chou publish the secret of my
house and violate ’thy sworn promise of silence?
Knowest thou not Galizin? In whose power it is to
hang thee, and thus (clenching his hand) to squash
theeg for know that it is something to be ’che tyrant
even in one’s own house.”
