APPENDIX

The notes in this appendix are arranged alphabeti-
cally. They contain additional information about cer-
tain persons and other matters in the text, and they are
intended to assist the reader in understanding various
remarks and allusions of the Diary.

The method of transliteration of Russian names
adopted by Count Macdonnell has—with a very few
exceptions-—been observed in reprinting the excerpts
from the Diary. Other methods of spelling these names
have been added in parenthesis in order that readers
desimus for further information should have no difficulty
in finding the names in works of reference.

Minor errors which are of importance to the historian
only and about which the author himself admitted his
doubts have not been commented on, as for instance the
rumor, which was erroneous, that Shukova, a confidential
chamberwoman of Czarina Martha, had been buried alive
as a punishment for being implicated in the revolt of the
Strelitz. In the same way the correspondence with the
Strelitz ascribed by the author of the Diary to Sophia
was as a matter of fact written by the Czarina Martha.

Regarding the completeness of Count Macdonnell's
translation (see Introduction p. xxiii) the rather prudish
count omitted page 70 of the Latin original describing
in a Chauccresque style the nightly bacchanalia of the

Muscovite clcrics with their wives. Other passages in
