PUNISHMENT OF THE STRELITZ 57

Boriska Broskurad was executed in the camp, by
command of Genera] ¹Schachin.

Takuska, who had been chosen first Major of the
White Regimemt‚ and two other inferior Officers,
among whom, as they were approaching Moscow, a
dispute arose which occasioned some day's delay,
were the cause of their own destruction, and saved
the lives of all well-disposed people.

Deacon Ivan Gabrielowicz had, some years pre—
viously, courted the Princess Marpha to yield to his
passion. The rebels >would have this fellow married
to Marpha‚3 to be protector of the Strelitz or high
chancellor3 but in consequence of the sinister turn
of their criminal undertaking, his funeral and
obsequies, instead of his nuptials, marked the
event.

Certain popes that were connected with the
Strelitz became sharers in their treason. For they
put up prayers to God to favor the efforts of treason‚
and it was they who carried the images of the
Blessed Virgin and Saint Nicholas among armod
men, and who had promised to draw the people to
the side of the revolt, under the protense of the
marked justice of the causo, and of true piety.
Hence one of them was hanged by the Czar's buf-
foon, near the high church dedicated to the most
Holy Trinity; another, being first bcheaded with

3Α sister of Czar Peter and Sophia.
