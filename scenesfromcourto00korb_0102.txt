72 COURT OF PETER THE GREAT

impurpled the plain far and wide with civil -’tis
true—but impious blood. General Lefort and
Baron de Blumberg were invited also to this hang-
man’s office, but were excused on alleging that it was
foreign from the manners of the eountries they came
from. The Czar himself, sitting in his saddle, looked
on *with dry eyes at the whole tragedy—at this
frightful butchery of such a multitude of men—
being only irate that several of the Boyars had per-
formed this unaceustomed function with trembling
hands —for that no fatter victim could be immolated
to God than a wicked man.

LAsT EXECUTION.-—- 313t October, 1698.-— Again‚
in front of the Kremlin Castle two others, whose
thighs and extremities had been broken, and who
were tied to the wheel, with horrid lamentations
throughout the afternoon and the following night,
closed their miserable existence in the utmost agony.
One of them, the younger of the two, survived amidst
his enduring tortures until noon the following day.
The Czar dined at his ease with the Boyar Leo
Kirilowicz Nareskin, all the representatives and the
Czar’s ministers being present. The successive and
earnest supplications of all present induced the mon-
arch, who was long reluctant, to give command to
that Gabriel 9 who is so well known at his court that
an end might be put with a ball to the life and pangs
of the criminal that still continued breathing.
