A WINTER IN MOSCOW 111

grace of which a dwarf drummer increased in the
same proportion as nature had curtailed in his per-
son the common stature of mankind. The soldiers’
uniforms were blue. Every regiment had two hands
of musicians, each composed of eighteen instru-
mentalists. The Bebraschentsko regiment was fol-
lowed by eight, and the others by six pieces of can-
non. Almost all the Officers of these regiments are
German by birth or origin. A place was railed off
upon the icc—bound river. Gordon’s regiment was
drawn up across the stream above, Semonowski be-
lom and that of Bebraschentsko longitudinally about
the place where the enclosure was erected. That
week General Lefort’s regiment happened to be on
guard, in consequence of which two companies of
it escorted the clergy, and two more, with white
wands in their hands, made way and kept off the
pressure of the crowd. Immediately in front of the
ropes, went twelve semslvoi (sewers of the Czar’s
kitchen) carrying brooms to keep the strects clean.
Five hundred ecclesiastics‚ sub-deacons, deacons‚
priests, abbots, bishops, and archbishop3, clad in the
vestments proper to their dignity and office, and
gleaming with ornature of gold and silver, and gems
and precious stones, lent an air of greater majesty
to devotion. Before a splendid gold cross twclve
clerics bore a lantern with three burning wax lights3
the Muscovites consider it unlawful and shameful for
the cross to appear in public unattended with lights.
