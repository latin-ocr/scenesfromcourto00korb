56 COURT OF PETER THE GREAT

in some degree restored, he was subjected to the
question anew, and fainted away under the sharpest
tortures.

Batska Girin, the insurgent ringleader, after un-
dergoing four times the most exquisite tortureS, con-
fessing nothing, was condemned to be hanged. But
on the very day appointed for his execution, there
was led out of prison, with the rebel Strelitz, to the
question, a certain youth of twenty years of age,
on being confi-onted with whom, he, of his own ac-
cord, broke his stubborn silence, and revealed the
counsels of the traitors, with all the circumstances.
Now that youth of twenty had fallen in by chance
with these rebels near the borders of Smolensko, and
being forced to wait on the principa] instigators of
the mutiny, they took no notice of his listening, nor
was his presence forbidden even when they used to
deliberate about the success of their nefarious en-
terprise. When he was dragged along with the
rebels before the tribunal, he, in order to prove his
innocence more easily, cast himself at the judge’s
feet, and with the most ardent siglis implored not to
be subjected to the torture— that he would confess
all that he knew with the most exact truth. Batska
Girin, who was condemned to the halter, was not
hanged before having made his judicia] confession3
for he was one of the prime rebels, and an excellent
witness of what he very truly detailed.
