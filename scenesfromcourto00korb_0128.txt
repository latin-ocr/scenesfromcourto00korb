98 COURT OF PETER THE GREAT

sultation was next thing to an altercation— neither
words nor hands being spared, every one being ex-
cited beyond measure, each defending his own opinion
with obstinacy‚ and with a warmth perilous beneath
the eye of Majesty. They differed so widely that
they almost abused one another. Two, whose lowlier
rank excused them from mingling in this knotty dis-
cussion, sought to win the favor due to a capital
funny joke by another description of clownishness‚
trying, as something quite fine, to hit one another’s
heads with the bread which they found upon the
table3 for they all, in their own way, did their best to
give genuine proofs of their true origin. Yet even
among the Muscovite guests some there were whose
more modest speech with their Prince betokened high
character of soul. An undisturbable gravity of
manners was remarkable in the aged Prince Leo
Hugowicz Tzerkaski, ripe prudence of counsel char-
acterized Boyar Golowin; an apt knowledge of public
affairs was distinguishable in Artemonowicz3—men
who shone all the more, as their species was evidently
very rare. The last that Ι have named, indignant
that so many, and such a variety of madmen, should
be admitted to a royal banquet‚ addressing the
Dumnoi of the Siberian Pricassa in Latin (which he
knows well), exclaimed aloud: “Stultorum plena
sunt omnia‚'’ (i. e„ ‘⁶ the whole place is full of
fools,”) so that his words might easily reach the
ears of all that knew Latin.
