III
REVOLT OF THE STRELITZ

Y a common sport of fortune i'c very often

happens that when a friend would extinguish
the houses of his neighbors which the flames are de-
vouring‚ his own is involved in the same peril. And
so it is not without reason that we deplore a calamity
’chat may befall ourselves as often as Ucalegon
hard-by is on fire.

Everybody knows that when the Poles were about
'co proeeed to the vote for 'che election of a monarch
to the throne of their widowed Republic, their strug-
gles were divided between two candidates. These
wild gusts bursting beyond the narrow limits of the
Diet‚ among ’this fiery people‚ burning as they are
with subtle and active intrigue menaced a 'tempest
fraught with universal danger. The Czar of Mos-
cow, roused by the proximity of the peril, ordered a
strong body of ’troops under the command of General
Knes Michael Greegorowicz Romadonowski ’to lie in
observation upon ’che frontiers of Lithuania, so as
to be able, should public disorders arise out of the

strife of private individuals‚ to settle them promptly
