REVOLT OF THE. STRELITZ 23

waiting for this command, and lost no time in firing
with such precision into their rebel ranks that their
furious passions were checked, and the strifc of re-
sistance and skirmishing of the mutineers was
changed into a piteous slaughter.

When they saw that some were stretched useless,
courage and fierceness at once deserted the terror-
stricken Strelitz, who broke in disorder. Those that
retained any presence of mind, endeavored by the
fire of their own artillery to check and silence that
of the Czar3 but all in vain3 for Colonel de Grage
had anticipated that design, and directing the fire
of his pieces upon the artillery of the seditious mob,
whenever they would go sto their gnus, vomited such
a perfect hurricane upon them, that many fell, num-
bers fied away, and none remained daring enough to
return to fire them. *Still Colonel de Grage did not
cease to thunder from the heights into the ranks of
the flying. The Strelitz saw safety nowhere3 arms
could not protect them3 nothing was more appalling
to them than the ceaseless flash and roal· of the
artillery showering its deadly bolts upon them from
the German right. And the same men who, but an
hour before, had spat upon proffered pardon, offered
in consequence to surrender—so short is the in-
terval that separates victors from vanquishcd. Sup-
pliant, they fell prostrate, and bcgged that ’the artil-
lery might cease its cruel ravages, offering to do
promptly whatever they were ordered.
