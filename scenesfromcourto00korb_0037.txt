FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF MOSCOW

14th May, 1698).- One of the Danish Lord
Envoy’s footmen had ridden to the church belonging
to the secretaries of the Confession of Augsburg.l
The horse, in yielding ’co a need of nature, spattered
a lieutenant’s wife who was passing by. With a
woman’s fury she showered opprobrious epithets
upon the footman; and in an obstinate, fierce rage,
went off to rouse her husband to revenge‚— telling
him that if he deserved to be called a husband he
would take signal vengeance for an insult that re-
flected upon himself. Excited with these outrageous
complaints and sobs, the lieutenant treacherously
fell upon the footman‚ and with the associates he
had brought with him to commit the outrage, so be·-
labored the man with cudgels that he could neither
wall< nor ride. The Danish envoy made a great com-
plaint of the lieutenant‚ and said, with great feeling,
’that he was attacked himself in the person of the
servant.
