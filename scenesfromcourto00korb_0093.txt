PUNISHMENT OF THE STRELITZ 63

hour of the death they had to undergo, There was
a cart for every criminal‚ and a soldier to guard
each. No priestly office was to be seen3 as if the
condemned were unworthy of that pious compassion.
But they all bore lighted tapers in their hands, not
to die without light and cross. The horrors of im-
pending death were increased by the piteous lamenta-
tions of their women, the sobbing on every side, and
the shrieks of the dying that rung upon the sad
array. The mother wept for her son, the daughter
deplored a parent’s fate, the wife lamenting a hus-
band's lot, bemoaned along with the others, from
whom the various ties of blood and kindred drew
tears of sad farewell. But when the homes, urged
to a sharp pace, drew them off to the place of their
doom‚ the wail of the women rose into louder sobs
and moans. As they tried to keep up with them,
forms of expression like these bespoke their> grief, as
others explained them to me: “ Why are you torn
from me so soon? Why do you desert me? Is a
last embrace then denied me? Why am I hindei-ed
from bidding him farewell? ’⁹ With complaints like
these they tried to follow their friends when they
could not keep up with their rapid course. From a
country seat belonging to General Schachin one hun-
dred and thirty more Strelitz were led forth to die.
At each side of all the city gates there was a gibbet
elected, each of which was loaded with six rebels on

that day.
