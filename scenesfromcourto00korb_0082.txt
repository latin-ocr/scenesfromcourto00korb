52 COURT OF PETER THE GREAT

So the owner of the cottage was brought up, and
the Czar inquired civilly of him a'bout the man and
the horse. But the hind denied any knowledge of
a horse being at his house. The Czar repeated the
question in a grave tone: but the fellow persisted in
his denial. The Czar urged him to remember that
he 'was speaking to his sovereign, the lord of his
limbs, in whose power were life and death. But the
thick-skulled clown was not in the least moved by
the threat, The Czar in consequence commanded
him to be thrown down on the ground and dreadfully
beaten from head to foot with a great knotty stick.

When on further interrogation—he still would
confess nothing, he was again most violently thrashed
from top to toe. Still the fellow remained contu-
maciously silent. They rolled him over again and
almost beat him to a mummy. But still at every
invitation of the knotty club the mangled rustic lay
like a block and stubbornly denied.

To such obstinate stubbornness are the souls of
these Muscovites hardened‚ that no torments — nay,
not the very presence of their sovereign —— can bend
them to confess the most manifest truth. For it
was found out shortly after by true and indubitable
proof‚ that this very rustic had kept the horse, and
had sent off the fugitive, with his brother as guide‚
by secret paths beyond Smolensk.
