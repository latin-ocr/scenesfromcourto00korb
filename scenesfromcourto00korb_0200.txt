170 COURT OF PETER THE GREAT

grandson, Peter ΙΙ., when she was released. She ap-
peared occasionally in court but the long seclusion had
dulled her mind and she died in 1731.

Her alleged lover Gliebof was executed less on ac-
count of his relations with her than for having sympa-
thized with Alexis. After having been tortured by the
knout, by redhot irons, and by burning coal he was fas-

elicit a last confession. For an answer Gliebof spit in

a similar though less cruel fate.

LEFORT, Francois.— An adventurer of Swiss-French
extraction, who in 1675, when only nineteen, had en-

Moscow where he married a cousin of Patrick Gordon.
After participating in various campaigns he settled down
in the Dutch Suburb (German Slowoda) at Moscow
where he met the young Czar. Peter chose him as one
of his advisers and favorites, which position he held until
his death. Things impossible to describe happened ac-
cording to Kurakin, one of Peter's companions in the
large hall added at Peter's expense to Lefort's house.
There were drinking banquets lasting for three whole
days during which not unfrequently some of the guests
died. In Lefort’s house Peter met also his first mis-
tress, Anna Mons.
