PUNISHMENT OF THE STRELITZ 59

act the Czar’s Majesty wept for his own lot and
Sophia's. Some will have it the Czar was on the
point of sentencing her to death, and used this argu-
ment: ‘⁶ Mary of Scotland was led forth from
prison to the block, by command of her sister Eliza-
beth, Quecn of England‚-—-a warning to me to ex—
ercise my power over Sophia.” 'Still once more the
brother pardoned a sister's crime, and, instead of
penalty, enjoined that she should be banished to a
greater distance, in some monastery.

It was rather the lust of sating her passions than
the desire of transferring dominion, that had en-
tangled Princess Marpha in the same rebellious ma-
chinations. She wanted to indulge more at ease in
her illicit connection with Deacon Ivan Gabrielowicz‚4
whom she had maintained at her own eost, for some
years, for that purpose. With her head shaved, she
has been thrust into a monastery and does penance
for the past.

Fiera and Schukmva, the former Sophia's, the
latter Marpha’s confidential chamber-woman, were
dragged from the Czar's Castle to Bebraschentsko
——the place of inquisition—and were both sub-
jected to the torture. When Piera, stripped naked
to the loins‚ was being scourged with what they call
the knout, the Czar observed that she was prcgnant;
and on being asked whether she knew the fact, she
did not dcny it, and moreover indicated a certain

450uvarow was his surname. See Appendiae.
