146 COURT OF PETER THE GREAT

died about seventeen years ago. This Almazow’s
household were taking too great freedom in sporting
with Easter eggs, and perhaps were more than usu-
ally uproarious. They did not stop when they were
forbidden by the watch, and maintained, that at the
Easter season custom warranted them. However,
the night watch was not of the same opinion, and
gave them warning to be off, unless they preferred
being cudgelled away. The others, exasperated‚ be-
gan brawling, and at length words came to blows.
Help was sent to the watch, but being insufficient,
was driven away by the infuriated domestics. The
matter being reported to Prince Michael Lehugowicz
Tzerkaski, orders were sent to the Chancellor to see
that Almazow’s guilty servants be taken into cus-
tody‚ and to send a scribe to his house with a force
of fifteen soldiers. The scribe either by a mistake
of his own, or by a spiteful order of the Chaneessor,
seized not the servants, but their master, who was
ignorant of the whole affair, and would have dragged
him off to a most villainous dungeon, if Colonel Gor-
don, who had got notice from the Dowager Czarine‚
Almazow's kinswoman, had not wr‘ested him from the
reluctant hands of the soldiers and scribe, and as-
signed him his own quarters as his place of arrest.
Certainly soldiers in Muscovy are in the habit of
tormenting prisoners in every way at their fancy,
without respect of persons or the matter of which
they are accused, bruising them with their muskets,
