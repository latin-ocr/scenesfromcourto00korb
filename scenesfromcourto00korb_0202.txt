172 COURT OF PETER THE GREAT

terview with Martha Glueck, the later Empress Cath-
erine, he enrichcd her with a solitary ducat. Peter was
not altogether incapable of appreciating the more deli-
cate charm of the company of women, and Russian
feminine society was one of his first creations. On the
whole however he preferred servant girls or similar
typeS. Such was Catherine, his second wife, who had
begun her career by wandering from camp to camp at
the disposal of the soldiers and officers of her future
consort.

The brother of Anna Mons, william, was accused
later of having had relations with Catherine, and was
executed. After the execution Peter passed the scaffold
in a sledge together with Catherine and 50 61056 that
her robes touched the body of her alleged lover. When
the Czarine appeared unmoved by the sight, Peter had
the severed head of William Mons preserved in alcohol
placed in her apartments. Many years afterward a
commission appointed to investigate the consumption of
spirits in the imperial household discovered two vessels
in the cellars of the castle containing the heads of a
former mistress of Czar Peter and of W'jlliam Mons,
which preserved their pristine beauty. The heads were
buried in the vaults of the castle by command of Cath-
erine II.
