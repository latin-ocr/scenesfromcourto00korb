RETURN OF THE CZAR 37

the foreign representatives‚ the Boyars, and other
persons distinguished by rank 01· favor, should be
invited to a grand banquet, given at his Majesty’s
chargeS‚ by Genera] Lefort. The minister of Den-
mark, in consequence of having incautiously given
up his credentials when asked to do so by the min-
istry, has been refused an audience of his Majesty
'che Czar on his return ; but he had so gained the good
graces of General Lefort, that he was admitted into
the house of the latter to kiss hands of the ·Czar
before sitting down to his table. In like manner
the envoy of Poland, having prematurely given up
his credentials‚ subjected himself to the same lot;
so that losing all hope of an audience, and begging
to be at least admitted to kiss hands, he obtained his
desire in a little closet where the glasses and drink-
:ing-bowls were kept. The envoy of Denmark
piqued himself greatly on his victory, vaunting that
he had been allowed the precedency because he was
the first that had the honor of kissing hands. As
these rivals were ambitiously contending about pre-
cedency, neither willing to be second to the other,
the Czar, in a passion, made use of a word familiar
to the Muscovites to express a disorder of the mind
— calling them Duralcs.2

His Majesty, during dinner‚ addressing the com-

2Ti durak (literallyz Thou donkey) is an expression still

familiar to high officials in Russia up to the nineteenth cen-
tury.
